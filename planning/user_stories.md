## Outline User Roles

### Regular User

A regular user is someone who joins the platform to explore music, share their tastes, and interact with others. They can create posts, browse feeds, connect their Spotify account, and engage with content through likes, comments, and reposts. Their goal is to express their musical identity and discover new tracks through social interaction.


### Artist

An artist is a user who creates and shares original music or curates musical content that reflects their creative journey. Artists can post their own tracks, share inspirations, and build a fanbase by connecting with listeners. They may also receive tailored analytics or promotional tools to help grow their audience.
