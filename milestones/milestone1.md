## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

During this unit, we were able to successfully obtain an idea and create various user stories for our project. We were similarly able to determine the various technologies that we can use for our project such as React, Express, Node.js, Render, Postgres, Spotify API, and more.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Although we did not face too many challenges during this unit, we were challenged by thinking about our requirements. This is because we want to make sure our implementation can run smoothly serving the design rather than the other way around.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

The additional support that we may need during the upcoming units is learning how to explore the Spotify API with great proficiency. This is because it is an integral part of our project, so we will need to familiarize ourselves with it and learn how to obtain the data we desire from it.
