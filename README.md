## About

### Description and Purpose

The purpose of our application is to provide a music-based social media community that allows users to share music and interact with each other based on their musical interests. The application allows for creativity and includes various features such as profiles, feeds, customizability, posting, and more.

### Inspiration

Inspirations for our project include social media apps like Threads, X, Instagram, Distrokid Slaps, among others. We will likely use their user interfaces as inspiration, to understand best UX and UI practices. Alongside this, we are highly inspired by the Spotify API and web player, since our core idea stemmed from these tools.

## Tech Stack

Frontend: React

Backend: Express.js, Node.js, Supabase, PostgresSQL

### Music-based Social Posting

Users can make posts about music, such as “mood” posts including a song, track review posts, or album/playlist sharing posts. These posts can include other components such as text or a user’s mood. The users can also edit their posts to change the song, album, playlist, or text.

### Integrate Profiile with Spotify OAuth

We allow users to connect their account with their Spotify account, and then we will be able to identify key parts of their data such as top tracks, listening habits, etc. This information will be integrated with the user’s profile, so that users can view each other’s liked music tracks, albums, genres, etc.
